              <p>
                This web app uses computer vision to identify the three highest
                probability diagnoses for a skin lesion. A more advanced version
                could be used to identify cancerous skin lesions early.

                   for skin pigmentation, grow in clusters instead of spreading throughout the skin. Moles can appear in various shapes, sizes,
                    and colors. While most moles are harmless, changes in size, shape, color, or sensation might indicate the need for further
                     evaluation

              <p>
                No. Once the model downloads it will be cached in memory. The
                next time you visit this site you won’t need to wait.
              </p>

              <p>
                That said, I suggest that you always use this tool with your web
                browser set to incognito mode. The model won’t be saved, but
                this will ensure that each time you visit this site you will
                always use the most up to date version of the model and not the
                old one that's stored in your device's memory.

              <p>
                Your images are never sent to an external server. Any image you
                submit stays on your computer or mobile phone. This is because
                the model is running on your device. This is also why a batch of
                images can be analyzed in less than two seconds.
              </p>

              <p>
                The tech that makes this possible is called Tensorflow.js. It
                was created by Google.

              <p>
                They are probability scores between 0 and 1. They show how
                confident the model is that a particular condition is present on
                the image. <br />
                For example, <i>mel, Melanoma: 0.231</i> means that the model is
                23% sure that the lesion shown in the image is melanoma.

                <b> What would it take to make this tool more trustworthy?</b>
              </p>

              <p>
                Three things are needed:<br />
                - Collaboration with a dermatologist/pathologist.<br />
                - More high quality labeled training data.<br />
                - Field testing.
              </p>

              <p>
                AI-based Espert Systems can be brittle. Good training scores
                don't guarantee that a model will perform well under real-world
                conditions. This tool first needs to be field tested. Then the
                model needs to be re-trained to make it more robust.
